Do you like hot dogs?,Is a hot dog a sandwich,Feel free to elaborate on your opinion below,Are You an Undergraduate
No,Yes,"if a sandwich is defined as something that has two same layers of material on the side and one/multiple layer of different material in the middle, then a hotdog is a sandwich. However, that definition is not well-defined, because it does not fully descibe all the properties of a sandwich. by the definition, a notebook is a sandwich.",Yes

Yes,No,"Hot diggity glizzies are not sandwiches. Sandwiches are traditionally and culturally consumed with two individual slices of bread and meat/veggies/etc between the two. Also, hot diggity glizzies are consumed with the bread oriented vertically on buns, unlike sandwiches that use slices of bread oriented in the horizontal/lateral direction. If anything, a hot dog is a sub. ",Yes
Yes,Yes,Sandwich is pieces of bread with a filling in it. What is hot dog? Bread with something in it. Aka sandwich. One might argue that hot dogs require their own category. Wrong!

Yes,No,"Its one bun, even if the connection is weak, the buns are still connected. Its basically the same as putting a slice of sandwich bread around it. Not a sandwich.",Yes
Yes,No,"A necessary component of being a sandwich is bread. But bread is not a necessary component of being a hot dog; we don't suddenly call it a sausage when it isn't between a piece of bread. Therefore, a hot dog is not a sandwich. QED.",Yes
Yes,Yes,"Due to the nature of hot dog buns as leavened bread encasing the meat, like a gyro, and societal concepts of a ‚Äúhot dog‚Äù as the entire entity of bun + dog + toppings‚Äîsaying a hot dog isn‚Äôt a sandwich is just being pedantic",Yes

Yes,Yes,"Think of a sub -- a hot dog is merely the protein on the sandwich. You can still add toppings (onions, condiments, cheese) and can grill the meet / toast the buns just like you can a regular sub. A sub is a sandwich, so a hot dog is too.",Yes
Yes,No,just because it is meat in bread doesnt make it a sandwich... like that means a wrap would be a sandwich no its not its a wrap. or a burger is a sandwich no its not its a burger,Yes

Yes,No,"Sandwich (noun): an item of food consisting of two pieces of bread with meat, cheese, or other filling between them, eaten as a light meal.

Hotdog (noun): hot dog; plural noun: hot dogs; noun: hotdog; plural noun: hotdogs
1. a frankfurter, especially one served hot in a long, soft roll and topped with various condiments.
""he's ordering a hot dog""

These definitions were retrieved from the Oxford language dictionary. A hot dog, as described, is a ‚Äòfrankfurter served hot in a long roll‚Äô. This roll typically is one cut piece of bread, but can also be two independent pieces, which would make a hotdog more sandwich-like. Additionally, it is important to note the distinction between the phrases ‚Äòserved in‚Äô and ‚Äòtwo pieces of bread with meat, cheese, or other filling between them‚Äô. The specificity of a hot dog could technically fit into the vague description of a sandwich. However, I would argue that a hot dog‚Äôs unique specificity allows it to be regarded as its own entity. A hot dog is ‚Äòserved in‚Äô a sliced roll, whereas a sandwich is ‚Äòtwo pieces of bread with meat, cheese, or other filling between them‚Äô. Yes, a hot dog could be served between two pieces of bread, however it is often one sliced roll and, therefore, should be regarded as something independent from a sandwich. Additionally, one who eats a hot dog between two pieces of sliced bread is usually thought of as ‚Äòweird‚Äô. Popular opinion often supports this belief (no source). Therefore, a hot dog is not, never has been, and never should be referred to as a sandwich, unless special circumstance requires a hot dog to be listed under the ‚Äòbetween the buns‚Äô part of a menu. The vagueness of ‚Äòbetween the buns‚Äô allows for the preservation of a hot dog‚Äôs unique specificity.",Yes

No,Yes,,Yes
Yes,No,Hot dogs are not sandwiches unless the bun splits into two. Don‚Äôt ask me about subs. ,Yes
Yes,No,"A hot dog is ostensibly a taco. The baked apparatus (whether it be made of wheat, rye, or corn [in the case of a taco]) is folded around three sides of the interior material. Any who break the lower region of the bun may argue that two sides are covered, and therefore the hot dog is a sand which. But they are objectively wrong to do so because the required and honest method of eating said delicacy involves resting the dog within a three sided pocket of bread. Either a hot dog is a taco or a taco is a hot dog. I will entertain no further discussion.",Yes
Yes,No,"A sandwich is defined as meat in between bread like substance, correct? Yes but not 100% the true. Not all meat in between bread is considered a sandwich. The reason is of the way the bread surrounds the hot dog. If we view the world in an xyz coordinate plane with x being left to right, y bring forward and backward, and z being up and down, you‚Äôll see that in a sand which the bread and meat exist in the xy plane, and lay flat on top of each other. However with a hotdog, the traditional way of forming a hotdog has the format in the yz plane. Another important aspect to look into is the intersection between planes. A sand which will have its layers confined, and the bread will never be fully on the same point in the z axis with the meat. Here are some of my examples to back up: 

Do u call a burrito a sandwich (meat between bread like substance right??) hell fucking no u don‚Äôt, and look how the bread and meat exist together in the z axis, something that should not happen. ",Yes

Yes,Yes,"Everything can be classified as a soup, a sandwich, a soup-sandwich, or a sandwich-soup. A hot dog is a simple form of a sandwich, just like cereal is a simple form of a soup. Both are so like a sandwich and a soup that they just are their respective categories.",Yes
